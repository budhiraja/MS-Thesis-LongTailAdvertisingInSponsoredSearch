I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. P. Krishna Reddy for his continuous guidance, patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. The door to Prof. Reddy's office was always open whenever I ran into a troubled spot or had a question about my research or writing. He consistently allowed this thesis to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it.

I would also like to thank my colleagues Raghav Kalyanasundaram, Sai Kavya Vaddadi, Mamatha Alugubelly, Amulya Kotni and Lakshmi Gangumalla for their constant support and for providing a positive learning environment. I am specially grateful to Sai Kavya Vaddadi for the brain storming sessions during my peak research months.

I also take this opportunity to thank Google Research India for providing travel grants to attend International Conference in Data Science and Advanced Analytics, 2015 at Paris, France. Furthermore, I would like to thank Microsoft Research India for supporting my travel to International Conference in Database Systems for Advanced Applications, 2017 at Suzhou, China for presenting my work at the conference.

Last but not the least, I express my deepest gratitude toward my parents, Sardar Harbans Singh and Bibi Paramjeet Kaur and my elder brother, Maninder Singh, for their unconditional support in all my endeavours.
